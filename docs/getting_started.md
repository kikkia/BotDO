# Intro
This bot's purpose is to provide some tools to help make managing a BDO guild/community a little easier on discord. 

# Family names
### Setting family name
Players should set their family name by using the `,setfamilyname` command.  
This is not required but allows some info given from the bot to be more in-game accurate. 
### Syncing family names with discord names
BETA: An experimental feature allows server admins to enforce family names show up in discord nicknames. The bot 
will automattically put the family name in users nicknames if they have it setup. 
(Still working a bit on this feature so use at your own risk)

# PlayerDirectory
You can look up players in game information with their family name. [See here](PlayerDirectory.md)

# Invites
The bot allows you to make invites to your discord server that have certain behaviour. I recommend looking [here](custom_invites.md)
for the best info on this feature.

# Scrolls
The bot allows you to track boss scrolls and form groups to keep track of everyone's scrolls. 
I recommend looking at [this page.](scrolls.md)

# Events
The bot can make and keep track of guild wide events. This is still under development, [this page ](events.md) will have the most updated info.
