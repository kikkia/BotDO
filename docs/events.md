# Events
Right now events are VERY bearbones. I have more features for events planned and there is a list at the bottom of the page.  
If you have more ideas feel free to reach out to Kikkia, or add them as a github issue.

## Creating an event
You can create an event with the `,addevent` command. This command will walk you through the creation of the event.

Events consist of a name, and a time, as well as a list of roles you can set. If you do set the roles than a user has to have at least one of those roles in order to see the event.  

## Seeing events
You can see all of the events available to you with the `,events` command.

## Planned features
- Adding boss times in as a different type of events
- Allowing users to setup alarms for events
- Adding a description to events
- Allowing users to "sign up" for events
- Event webpage (big stretch goal)
