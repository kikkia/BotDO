# Player Directory
This bot will scrape the BDO website to get family and guild membership information. Currently all it can do is simple lookups on players, later on it will work other aspects of the bot into the information here. 

### Looking up a players info
#### WhoIs command
You can use the whois command to find info about what guilds a player is in.  
Example `,whois kikkia` - gets info for the player with the family name, kikkia.
It will search NA by default, or whatever you set your default server to [Guide on default regions](regions.md)
